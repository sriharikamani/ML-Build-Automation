AUTO ML â€“ AUTOMATION OF MACHINE LEARNING MODEL BUILDING
-	Known as automated ML or AutoML
-	Meant to automate the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development activities
-	Traditional machine learning model development is 
o	Resource-intensive, 
o	Requires domain knowledge 
o	Time to produce and compare dozens of models. 
-	With automated machine learning, you'll accelerate the time it takes to get production-ready ML models with great ease and efficiency
-	And without extensive programming knowledge
The following settings can be configured
-	Supports ML tasks such as classification & regression
-	Allows to perform various pre-processing activities
o	Drop columns
o	Impute columns
o	Handling missing values
o	Binning
o	Numeric and Categorical variable scaling
-	Automatically notifies Class Balance distribution and outliers presence 
-	Provides option to show the correlation map
-	Provides Options for the user to select various data preparation techniques
o	Under & Over sampling
o	SMOTETomek / SMOTE / SMOTENC
-	Provides Options for the user to select various data split techniques
-	Provides Options for the user to select various data split techniques
-	Provides Options for the user to select various feature build & select
-	Provides Options for the user to select various models
The tool is a SMART, meaning
-	Validates the possible options based the problem type (Classification & Regression)
-	Final outcome will be a GUI based different metrics stats format shown in GUI to help data scientists to decide on which model will combination of options to take it forward without extensive programming knowledge
-
